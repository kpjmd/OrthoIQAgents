📋 INJURY CONTEXT:
- Body Part: ${bodyPart || 'Unspecified'}
- Mechanism: ${mechanism || 'Unknown'}
- Timeline: ${timeline ? `${timeline.value} ${timeline.unit}s ago (${timeline.phase} phase, Day ${timeline.totalDays})` : 'Unknown'}
- Age: ${age}
- Sport: ${sport || 'Not specified'}
- Context: ${injuryContext || 'Not specified'}

🧠 THINK LIKE A MOVEMENT SPECIALIST:
${mechanism && bodyPart ? `
- What joint mechanics were disrupted by this ${mechanism} injury to the ${bodyPart}?
- What arthrokinematics (gliding, rolling, spinning) need restoration?
- How is the kinetic chain compensating for this dysfunction?
- What movement patterns are at risk due to this ${timeline ? timeline.phase + ' phase' : ''} injury?
` : `
- What movement patterns are dysfunctional based on the symptoms?
- How does this affect the kinetic chain proximally and distally?
- What arthrokinematic restrictions need addressing?
`}

⚠️ PROVIDE EXPERT-LEVEL BIOMECHANICAL ANALYSIS:

1. **Clinical Reasoning** (Explain the biomechanics):
   ${mechanism === 'twist' && bodyPart === 'Knee' ? 'Example: "The twisting mechanism likely disrupted tibiofemoral arthrokinematics. Rotational forces may have damaged meniscal or ligamentous structures. The joint\'s normal gliding and rolling mechanics need restoration to prevent compensatory stress in the hip and ankle kinetic chain."' : 'Explain WHAT was disrupted biomechanically and WHY it matters for function and recovery.'}

2. **Specific Movement Restoration Protocol**:
   - Provide EXACT exercises with sets/reps/frequency/progression
   - Example: "Patellar mobilizations: 4 directions, 30 seconds each, 3x/day"
   - Example: "Heel slides for ROM: 3 sets of 15, twice daily, progress when reaching 0-120°"
   - NOT generic: "Movement pattern correction exercises"

3. **Phase-Appropriate Guidance** (${timeline ? timeline.phase : 'Current stage'}):
   ${timeline && timeline.phase === 'Early Proliferation' ? '- Focus: ROM restoration (target 80% of opposite side), neuromuscular control, early weight-bearing\n   - Avoid: High-impact, pivoting, deep flexion >90°' : '- Provide recommendations appropriate to injury timeline'}

4. **Progression Criteria** (Objective measures):
   - Example: "Progress when ROM reaches 0-120° and gait is symmetric with no antalgic pattern"
   - Define specific benchmarks, not vague timelines
