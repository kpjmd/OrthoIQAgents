- Mechanism: ${mechanism || 'Unknown'}
- Age: ${age}
- Sport: ${sport || 'Not specified'}

🧠 THINK LIKE A STRENGTH SPECIALIST:
${bodyPart === 'Knee' && timeline && timeline.phase === 'Early Proliferation' ? `
- What arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) is present? (VMO shutdown from effusion)
- What neuromuscular control is compromised?
- How do we progressively reload tissues at Week ${Math.floor(timeline.totalDays / 7)}?
- What functional benchmarks define readiness for next phase?
` : timeline ? `
- What muscle inhibition/atrophy has occurred at ${timeline.phase}?
- What neuromuscular patterns need restoration?
- What functional benchmarks define current recovery stage?
- How do we safely progress loading at this phase?
` : `
- What muscle inhibition/atrophy is present?
- What neuromuscular control deficits exist?
- What functional benchmarks are needed?
- How do we safely progress loading?
`}

⚠️ PROVIDE EXPERT-LEVEL STRENGTHENING PROTOCOL:

1. **Neuromuscular Reasoning**:
   ${bodyPart === 'Knee' && timeline && timeline.phase === 'Early Proliferation' ?
   `Example: "Joint effusion at ${timeline.phase} causes arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI), particularly affecting the vastus medialis oblique (VMO). This quadriceps shutdown limits functional capacity to ~70% and increases re-injury risk. Neural drive must be restored before progressive loading."` :
   `Explain neuromuscular inhibition: What muscles are inhibited? What's the mechanism? What's the functional impact? NOT generic "progressive strength training"`}

2. **Specific Strengthening Protocol** (${timeline ? timeline.phase : 'Current phase'}):
   ${bodyPart === 'Knee' && timeline && timeline.phase === 'Early Proliferation' ? `
   Daily Exercises:
   - Quad sets: 100 reps/day (sets of 10), 5-second holds
     Rationale: Restore neural drive to inhibited VMO
     Progression: Add ankle weight (2-5 lbs) when pain-free

   - Straight leg raises: 3 sets of 15, twice daily
     Form: Quad locked, lift to 45°, control descent
     Progression: Add weight when easy (start 2 lbs)

   - Terminal knee extension with band: 3 sets of 15 daily
     Focus: Final 30° of extension for VMO activation
     Progression: Increase band resistance weekly
   ` : `
   Provide EXACT exercises with:
   - Sets, reps, frequency (e.g., "3 sets of 15, twice daily")
   - Form cues and rationale
   - Progression criteria (when and how to advance)
   - NOT: "Progressive strength training program"
   `}

3. **Load Progression Strategy**:
   - Increase load 10% per week IF swelling stable
   - Monitor morning vs evening swelling differential
   - Reduce 50% if next-day swelling increases >5mm
   - Objective measures guide progression, not time alone

4. **Functional Milestones** (Objective):
   ${bodyPart === 'Knee' ? `
   - Advance when quad strength >80% of opposite leg (manual or handheld dynamometry)
   - Single-leg squat without valgus collapse
   - Gait symmetric, no antalgic pattern
   ${sport === 'Football' ? `\n   Football-Specific:\n   - Progress to agility when strength >90% opposite leg\n   - Return to contact when passing all tests + sport-specific drills pain-free` : ''}
   ` : `
   - Define specific, measurable functional benchmarks
   - Compare to opposite side or normative data
   - Include activity-specific criteria
