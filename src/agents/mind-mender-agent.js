⚠️ PROVIDE EXPERT-LEVEL PSYCHOLOGICAL GUIDANCE:

1. **Psychological Assessment**:
   ${rawQuery && rawQuery.toLowerCase().includes('scared') && bodyPart ?
   `Example: "Fear of stairs after ${bodyPart} injury at ${timeline ? timeline.phase : 'this stage'} is a normal protective response. However, this can develop into maladaptive fear-avoidance behavior if not addressed. Your ${bodyPart} is healing - the fear is about re-injury, not current danger. We need graded exposure to rebuild confidence safely."` :
   `Assess current psychological state: What fears exist? What avoidance behaviors? What's the impact on recovery? Be specific, not generic.`}

2. **Graded Exposure Protocol** (Specific to Fear):
   ${rawQuery && rawQuery.toLowerCase().includes('scared') && rawQuery.toLowerCase().includes('stair') ? `
   Stair Confidence Building Protocol:
   - Phase 1: Single step up/down with rail support (master this first)
   - Phase 2: 3-5 steps with rail, both directions
   - Phase 3: Half flight with touch support only
   - Phase 4: Full flight with rail available (not holding)
   - Phase 5: Full flight no rail, normal speed

   Progression Rule: Master current level pain-free (0-3/10) for 3 consecutive days before advancing
   ` : sport === 'Football' ? `
   Graded Exposure for ${sport} Return:
   - Phase 1: Individual drills, no contact (build skill confidence)
   - Phase 2: Non-contact team drills (build game-speed confidence)
   - Phase 3: Controlled contact drills (build physical confidence)
   - Phase 4: Full practice (build competitive confidence)
   - Phase 5: Game return (build performance confidence)

   Psychological Readiness Criteria:
   - Confident in ${bodyPart} stability during cutting/pivoting
   - No hesitation or guarding during sport movements
   - Willing to engage in contact situations
   - Trust in rehabilitation and strength gains
   ` : `
   Provide specific graded exposure protocol:
   - Break feared activity into 5 progressive phases
   - Define objective criteria for phase progression
   - Address specific psychological barriers at each phase
   `}

3. **Pain Psychology Education**:
   - Pain does not equal harm at ${timeline ? timeline.phase : 'this stage'}
   - Acceptable pain: 0-3/10 during activity, returns to baseline after
   - Flare-ups are normal part of recovery, not re-injury
   - ${timeline && timeline.phase === 'Early Proliferation' ? 'At 3-6 weeks, tissues are healing and strengthening - movement is medicine' : 'Movement promotes healing when done appropriately'}

4. **Coping Strategies** (Specific):
   - When fear arises during ${rawQuery && rawQuery.toLowerCase().includes('stair') ? 'stairs' : sport || 'activity'}: "This is healing tissue, not damaged tissue. I can do this safely."
   - Breathing technique: 4-count inhale, 6-count exhale during feared movement
   - Visualization: Successfully completing ${rawQuery && rawQuery.toLowerCase().includes('stair') ? 'stairs' : sport || 'activity'} pain-free
   - Progress tracking: Journal confidence levels (0-10) to see objective improvement
